# The-Shockwaves-of-Trade-The-Dark-Side-of-Exposure-and-Rising-Gun-Violence
We analyze how exposure to Chinese import competition impacts distress measures within communities, including mass shooting probability, opioid-related deaths, suicides, poverty rates, and inequality. Using Ordinary Least Squares Methodology, we uncover a puzzling link between exposure and inequality, potentially reducing shooting probabilities. Additionally, we find a significant increase in shooting probability after a previous mass shooting incident, a novel finding in the literature. We recommend policymakers consider exposure as a monitoring variable to understand risks within their countyâ€™s socioeconomic fabric.
